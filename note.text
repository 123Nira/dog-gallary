// a function which is responsible to fetch data from server and pass it to parseJsonResponse() function

  // we are using fetch api to make rest api calls. you can use axios .
    // we are also using promises here.
      // we get raw response. need to first convert it into json format so we can use the data easily
       // if any error occurs like no internet connection then this callback will be called
           // we need only breed names from this object which are actually all the keys of this object
    // so we can use Object.keys(object) function to get a list of all the keys in this object
